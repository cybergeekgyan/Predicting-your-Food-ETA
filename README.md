# Predicting-your-Food-ETA
Predicting the Estimated Time of Arrival and Food Delivery Time using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Dataset
Food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters.

## Evaluation Metrics
